## Reporting Security Issues

We take security very seriously. Interr is built with security as a core principle — all media can be End-to-End Encrypted (E2EE) so that no intermediate server can access your calls.

If you find (or simply suspect) a security vulnerability in this project, please report it responsibly by opening a **private** GitHub Security Advisory on this repository.

**Please do not post security vulnerabilities in public issues. Responsible disclosure protects our users.**
